# SSR with dynamic page structure

There are many challenges when doing Server Side Rendering with React (or any other similar stacks), it is not _only_ about setting up redux, or select the best CSS framework. The first challenge is on the logical architecture level, where do we put business logic, how can we do data aggragation, how can we do http caching with user's data, etc ... The second challenge, is how can add flexibility to the end user to administrate the page strucure or template (and not only contents).

This project try to resolve these two challenges.
